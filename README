XComp
=====

XComp compares any number of column in any number of file between them. Quick
and dirty solution to a problem, it does actually understand only
tab-separated files and does only string comparison (case-sensitive).
Comparison is multi-threaded, one thread per comparison up to all your 
processor cores minus one.

Installation
------------

 - Run `make`. 
 - Copy xcomp in /usr/local/bin.

Usage
-----

Take on stdin lines in the form of "filepath:colunm_number\n"
Try to run ./xcomp < test.in

Todo
----
 - Unicode support
 - Improves output
 - Support for different input file format
 - Certainly bug fix

Note
----

Uses a lot of pointers. Run it with valgrind as often as possible.
